				<h2>Local Dev Setup</h2>
				<p>
					Create a folder where you would like to work on this project. I
					believe it is important to get comfortable with the terminal so I
					will demonstrate creating folders and files in the terminal.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the next slide, we will use the terminal to create all of the
					folders and files for the initial setup. The files will be empty at this point. We will go back and pour in
					the code in later steps
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Local Dev Setup | structure</h2>
				<div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"">
            <p>
              We will move to the desktop folder and create a new folder called
              jepsometer. Then we will move into the jepsometer folder.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						cd ~/Desktop && mkdir jepsometer && cd jepsometer
					</code></pre>
          </div>

          <div class=" fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
					<p>
						Now that we are in the folder we will be using, let's initialize
						the HubSpot CLI so that it can communicate with your account
					</p>
					<pre><code class="" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						hs init
					</code></pre>
				</div>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
					This will guide you through authenticating the HubSpot CLI with your
					account. When you are done, you will have a hubspot.config.yml file
					in your folder
				</p>
				<div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
					<p>
						Next step is to create a project which will act as the container
						for our app in our account. The CLI will ask you a series of
						questions including name of the project, location and if you wan to use a template. Call your project
						jepsometer and choose the
						default location and no template
					</p>
					<pre><code class="" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						hs project create
					</code></pre>
				</div>
				<p class="fragment fade-in">
					You should now have two files in your folder. hubspot.config.yml
					and hsproject.json
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="">
				<h2>Local Dev Setup | Optional package.json file</h2>
				<p>This file is optional, but will make your life slightly easier as you won't have to navigate to other
					directories to install dependencies.</p>
				<div class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">
					<p> From your terminal and still in the main folder, type this command</p>

				<h2>local dev setup | private app </h2>
				<p>UI extensions require a private app to function. A single private app can be used for multiple custom cards
				</p>
				<div class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">
					<p> From your terminal and still in the main folder, type the following command</p>
					<pre><code class="bash" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						mkdir src && cd src
						</code></pre>
					<pre><code class="bash" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						mkdir app && cd app

						touch app.json
						</code></pre>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>local dev setup | extensions </h2>
				<p>We are are now at the meat of the project. The extensions folder we are about to create is where we will be
					building the custom card. For a custom card to work, it needs to in the extensions folder and it requires a
					minimum of 3 files.</p>
				<ul class="fragment fade-in">
					<li>custom-card.json</li>
					<li>CustomCard.jsx or CustomCard.tsx</li>
					<li>package.json</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="fragment fade-in-then-fade-out">
					Although a custom card requires a package.json file, this file can be shared amongst multiple cards
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>local dev setup | extensions </h2>
				<p>Lets create our extensions folder and the files in it</p>
				<div class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">
					<p> From within the app folder, run the following commands in your terminal</p>
					<pre><code class="bash" data-trim data-line-numbers>
										mkdir extensions && cd extensions
										</code></pre>
					<pre><code class="bash" data-trim data-line-numbers>

				<h2>local dev setup | serverless functions</h2>
				<p>On its own, the front end of the custom card is very powerful and can display a wealth of data about the
					record it is on and its associations, but if you want to dig deeper into your CRM or if you want to interact
					with data outside of your CRM, serverless functions are the next step.</p>
				<p>In this demo, we will be calling a
					serverless function to interact with a HubDB table hosted on a different HubSpot account. This hubdb table
					will control how a website page displays data.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>Serverless functions are stored in a folder called app.functions and, similar to the custom card, require 3
					files</p>
				<ul class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">
					<li>functionName.json</li>
					<li>serverless.json</li>
					<li>package.json</li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h2>local dev setup | serverless functions </h2>
				<p>Let's create the app.functions folder and the files in it</p>
				<p class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">Again, in your terminal, we will need to navigate out of the
					extensions
					folder and back into the app folder.
					The we will create the new folder and files in the new folder</p>
				<div class="fade-in-then-semi-out fragment">
					<p> From within the app folder, run the following commands in your terminal</p>
